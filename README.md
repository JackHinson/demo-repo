# Demo Repo
This is a demonstration repository for Lab 06 in hopes to teach us how to use the Version Control System (VCS) git, which takes "snapshots" of every version and uploads to a linked repository in github.

The basic git commands used to create this README.md file and sending it to git required setting up the repository with git init. Then, it helps to check the git status to see which files have been modified, but are currently untracked. To start tracking the file write the command git add <filename>. Once the desired changes are made use git commit and label the change with a meaningful caption. The changes will be updated to github with the command git push origin master

Learning git and how to modify versions in github will be very helpful in tracking our work. It is important to see progress in a project as well as provide feedback. In addition, if mistakes are made one can always revert back to a previous version and start again very easily.
